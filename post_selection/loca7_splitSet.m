%% split the set into two, making sure that the 20 stimuli are always presented into 2 repetitions of the same type
% 10 STIMULI EACH REPETITION = 10 FW, 10 SFW, 10 BW, 10 SBW, 10 LD, 10 SLD
% 6 REPETITIONS = 6 TIMES 10 0 3 TIMES THE TOTAL 20 STIMULI

% Not necessary to repeat the same ones (e.g. always the broom) 
% for each (two) repetitions: randomize the set for each category (order of
% fw should be different from order of sfw), then for 1st repetiton take
% 1-10, for 2nd take 11-20.
% Do this 3 times and we get which stimuli go where.
